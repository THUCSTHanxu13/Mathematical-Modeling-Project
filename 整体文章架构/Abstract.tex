\begin{abstract}
The goal of an abstract is to give an overall description of the paper. We should illustrate these points: \\

1)A little background of the problem.

2)Our basic model

3)Our new model, namely what is the improvement of this model compared with those previous ones. Some descriptions about the weakness of previous models(which are what we are trying to solve).

4)The good results we get from our new model.

In general, the abstract must illustrate what we have done in this paper and the significance of these improvements(usually by showing those good results we have).
