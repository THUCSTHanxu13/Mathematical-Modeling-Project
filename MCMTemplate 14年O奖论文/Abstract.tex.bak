Our goal is a model that can evaluate the performance of the keep-right-except-to-pass rule and other alternatives by simulating the traffic flow on the freeway. We construct models to analyze five influencing factors. Then we integrate multiple criteria to judge the performance of nine rules using a fuzzy synthetic evaluation(FSE).

Our basic lane-changing model focuses on the behavior of a specific vehicle on freeway. We carefully examine the vehicle¡¯s lane-changing behavior, an essential component of overtaking.

We extend our model with a cellular-automaton-based approach. We assume that the drivers will change the lane with a probability if the trigger and safety conditions are satisfied. Using periodic boundary conditions, we seek to simulate a section of a long freeway, which is hardly influenced by the real boundary conditions. In addition, we can accurately control the occupancy of the freeway. We can simulate the traffic flow under several circumstances by varying the number of lanes, maximum speed limit, minimum speed limit and signaling behavior,

Four other basic rules such as free-overtaking rule and no-overtaking rule are examined by revising the laws governing the cells in the cellular automaton. Then we propose five improved rules based on the basic rules attempting to design an optimal rule.

We choose flow rate, average speed as traffic flow criteria, sharp braking frequency as a safety criterion and satisfaction and standard deviation of speed as experience criteria. Then we use a fuzzy synthetic evaluation technique to integrate these criteria to determine the performance of each rule. We find that in a light traffic case, a partial-assigned-lane-and-keep-right rule performs the best while in a heavy traffic situation, a different-speed-limit-on-each-lane rule is preferred.

We change the probability of lane-changing to adjust our extended model to a country like Great Britain. Moreover, we define the probability of changing to the left lane as 1, based on which we propose two kinds of intelligent system.

Additionally, we refine our extended model to consider the ramps. Using the open boundary conditions, we assume that the vehicles flowing in is Poisson-distributed. We change the parameters to analyze the freeway with ramps under different conditions.
